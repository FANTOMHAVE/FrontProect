            Forrest Gump is a 1994 American comedy-drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Eric Roth. 
            It is an adaptation of the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom and stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, 
            Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field.

The film follows the life of an Alabama man named Forrest Gump (Hanks) and his experiences in the 20th-century United States. 
Principal photography took place between August and December 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. 
Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate Hanks into archived footage and to develop other scenes. 
The soundtrack features songs reflecting the different periods seen in the film.
